# Design notebook for week ending April 24, 2016

## Last week's critique

**TODO:** Fill in this part with a summary and reflection on the critque you
received for last week's work. Answer questions such as:  How, specifically, did
the feedback help improve the project? Did the feedback point out or offer
something you hadn't considered? Did it help you make a design decision? Was it 
helpful in addressing the most pressing issues in your project? How will you
incorporate the feedback into your work? Will you change something about the 
design, implementation, or evaluation as a result?

Mostly, the critique just assured me that I don't need to focus on adding more features. As a result, my focus was on actually writing more programs in my language and using those to discover things I'd forgotten or other nice things that I might want to change. I don't really have any pressing issues at this point.

## Description

**TODO:** Fill in this part with information about your work this week:
important design decisions, changes to previous decisions, open questions,
exciting milestones, preliminary results, etc. Feel free to include images
(e.g., a sketch of the design or a screenshot of a running program), links to
code, and any other resources that you think will help clearly convey your
design process.

I didn't do a lot this week either - mostly just writing some stuff in my DSL, and particularly trying to write things in somewhat different ways. I have a ton more possible ideas for improving the language, but I think I'm going to implement a lot of them after the class when I'm not under time pressure to implement them. I'm almost certainly going to be working more on my language after this class. Working in the language is turning out to be an excellent way to generate these ideas. A couple that I'm having from this work including allowing basic shapes (rather than just primitive animations) to be rendered by rules, or allowing modifications to be specified randomly (i.e., hue: [0, 30] to increase hue by some amount between 0 and 30). 

I'm pretty happy with some of the things I've made with the language. I've made things that use nondeterminism both very heavily and not at all, things that loop copmletely and that don't, things that are totally abstract and one simple abstracted scene of a landscape or a sunset.  

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

Nothing really at this point.

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

Again, nothing in particular.

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**

Only a few hours.
